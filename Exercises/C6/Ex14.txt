Pseudo code for palindrome recognition algorithm using stack

s = string needs to be identify

aStack = a new empty stack

while (not the middle of s) {
    ch = the current char;
    aStack.push(ch);
}

while (aStack is not empty) {
    if (ch != aStack.peek()) then s is not a palindrome;
    aStack.pop();
}

else s is a palindrome.
