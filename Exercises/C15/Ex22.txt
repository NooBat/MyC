a.

Algorithm 1: ["Jane", "Bob", "Alan", "Elisa", "Tom", "Nancy", "Wendy"]

Algorithm 2: ["Jane", "Bob", "Tom", "Alan", "Elisa", "Nancy", "Wendy"]

b.

For Algorithm 1 we can use the ADT stack for keeper C.
For Algorithm 2 we can use the ADT queue for keeper C.

The ADT should contains the pointer to each node in the tree.
