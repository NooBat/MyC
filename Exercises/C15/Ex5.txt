a.
Specifications:
    - Checks whether the root node is a leaf node or not.
    - Precondition: None
    - Postcondition: The tree and node remains unchanged. 
    - Returns: True if the node is leaf, otherwise false.

isLeaf(): bool
{
    isLeaf := true;     //Assume the node is a leaf node

    if rootNode is NULL then isLeaf := false;
    else
    {
        if rootNode have a child (left or right child) then isLeaf := false;
    }

    return isLeaf;
}
