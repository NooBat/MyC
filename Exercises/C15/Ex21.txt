Base case: with 1 leaf node we have 2 * 1 - 1 = 1 node. This is true since tree with 1 node 
is both a root and a leaf node.

Assume this is correct for k leaves => 2 * k - 1 = 2k - 1 nodes.

With k + 1 leaves, we have 2k + 1 nodes. If we want to add 1 leaf to the tree, we have to add 
2 nodes on both side of the parent node. Because with 1 node added this would violate the properties of 
the strictly binary tree. So k leaves lead to 2k - 1 nodes, hence k + 1 leaves lead to 2k + 1 nodes. 

=> This is true for all real numbers.
